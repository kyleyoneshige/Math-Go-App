# Math_Go_Application

  Math GO! is an application currently designed for android that has a few different goals. First, it is meant to be fun! It is a game about catching beasties in the world, spawned randomly based on the userâ€™s location. Beasties will spawn on the map for the user and they will have the opportunity to catch them. However, in order to catch the beasties, the second goal of the application comes into effect. The user must correctly answer a math question, where the questions generally have a theme related to the beastie being caught (some exceptions). 

  If the user is able to properly answer the question, they will add the beastie to their collection! The application will display a leaderboard for who has the most beasties caught, and each time someone catches one it will be updated in the database. With this application, target users have the opportunity to play a game for enjoyment while at the same time learn and challenge themselves mathematically.
